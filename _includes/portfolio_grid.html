                    <p class="text-muted">Hosted in <strong>Dublin from 30 May - 1 June, 2018</strong>, CarpentryCon 2018 will be the key networking and community-building
                        event in our annual calendar.
                       Some of the brightest and most promising researchers and data scientists from around the world will meet to network, to learn 
                        about digital research tools and the practice of reproducible, open science, 
                        and to further develop the coding, communication and project management skills research and industry are crying out for. 
                        However, CarpentryCon will only be possible with the generous support of businesses and foundations who support our mission of 
                        teaching foundational computational and data science skills to researchers to safeguard the future of sound, open, reproducible science. </p>
                                        
                    <p class="text-muted">There are many ways to support CarpentryCon 2018. We are seeking <strong>one Leading Sponsor</strong> to support the event
                        as a whole, and we would welcome other supporting sponsorships that would allow us to cover our many costs, and to offer travel scholarships and prizes. <br \> </p>
