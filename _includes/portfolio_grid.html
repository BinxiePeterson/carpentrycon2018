                        eventin our annual calendar.
                       Some of the brightest and most promising researchers and data scientists from around the world will meet to network, to learn 
                        about digital research tools and the practice of repoducible, open science,

                        However, CarpentryCon will only be possible with the generous support of businesses and foundations who support our mission of 
                        teaching foundational computational and data science skills to researchers to safeguard the future of sound, open, reproducible science. </p>
