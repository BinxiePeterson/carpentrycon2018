                        skills to researchers through short, intensive workshops. Workshop organizers must be

                    <p class="text-muted">Both Software and Data Carpentry workshops are taught by certified instructors, all of whom have 
                        completed this two-day <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/">training course</a>. Instructors 
                        are volunteers.
                        We have a body of Trainers (currently about 40) who run these workshops so that we can grow our 
                        instructor pool, and take Carpentry workshops to new countries and communities. Trainers are also volunteers.</p>
                        
                        Training is generally run on behalf of member organizations who leverage their investment in
                    the Carpentries to grow their internal training capacity. Some open trainings are offered each year.
